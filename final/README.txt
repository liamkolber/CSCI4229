As far as what is present in the scene in this review, the trees that might be seen floating toward the back will be sized and moved to actually be flush with the terrain. This is to mimic a forest. Also, the block of terrain that the field is currently sitting on will be smoothed to blend with the shape of the terrain more nicely.

Unfortunately, the texture for the field and the ground were too large of file sizes and we didn't have time to change them prior to submission, so they have weak textures added temporarily. This will be fixed.

Texturing the TIE fighter and X-Wing was more work than initally planned, but we should have that finished in the next couple days. We also plan on adding two more fighters each to represent a team. All of these fighters will be on predetermined paths aside from one TIE fighter which will be controlled by the user (most likely in first-person) to demonstrate the gameplay once that is added.

We have begun designing the texture for the HUD and plan to have that up by the end of next week. Lastly, the gameplay is our next major step to take. We plan on having one specified fighter be conrollable by the user. Features for gameplay will include a method by which to score points such as shooting a ball through one of the hoops.

As far as what is deserving of an A thus far, all the textures used in this project (with the exception of the sky) were made ourselves in photoshop. We also have a variety of objects of varying sizes and complexities, all of which are properly lit and most of which are textured (some, like the hoops, aren't textured as they are simply solid gold structures). Once we get gameplay running, the movements fine tuned, and the objects finalized, the project should overall be deserving of an A.
